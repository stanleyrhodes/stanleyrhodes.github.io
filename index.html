        		<p>I investigate what big factors in environments, and in the social and cognitive properties of people, lead to patterns of organizational structure such as hierarchies and recorded policies. I'm currently a PhD student at Utah State University, advised by Dr. Jacob Freeman. I use agent-based models, network analysis, and statistical learning techniques.</p>
					
				<p>My current research includes two big, different threads of inquiry.</p>
				
				<p>The first focuses on using agent-based models to test the performance of hierarchical organizational structures. I use the model to generate varied problem environments which social agents then attempt to "solve" with limited decision-making ability. I'm looking for those conditions and dynamics that are necessary and sufficient for hierarchy to be worth it for the group of agents.</p>
	
				<p>The second focuses on applying text mining (i.e. LDA topic modeling) to US law (i.e. the US Statutes at Large) to map the evolution of topics over time and jurisdiction.</p>
