        		<h2 id="home">Hello, my name is Stan Rhodes.</h2>
				
				<p>I'm interested in building transdisciplinary frameworks and theories that can bridge the social sciences. I try to find where the invisible can be made visible&mdash;where unseen commonalities between work in different domains suggests unifying core theory lurking beneath.</p>
				
				<p>I will be re-entering academia as a PhD student, to push hard to be the best scientist I can be. I've always been intensely passionate about social science, but in the corporate world I've developed the productivity and organizational skills I wish I had as an undergrad. Better late than never.</p> 
				
				<p>During the business day I'm a technical writer who creates documents for repairing semi trucks. I also manage a project system and metadata database for that body of documentation. (I wish the documentation were open access, but it's not. Yes, I've had truck drivers ask me about getting access to our service documentation!)</p>
				
				<h2 id="whycore">Why core theory?</h2>
				
				<p>At the core of all the social sciences  the fundamental models of abstraction involve agents. These agents interact by making decisions with specific computational structures, with constrained computational resources, and in varied conditions. Sometimes the agents are explicit, sometimes they are abstracted away to a single variable in an equation, but ultimately anything social involves agents.</p>
				
				<p>Each social science offers a different view, theorizing about some domain of sophisticated behaviors. And every discipline approaches the agents differently, trying to model them in a way that bridges them to the real-life sophistications in that field's focus.</p>

				<p>Emerging commonalities between these theories, and these fields, are undeniable. Interdisciplinary work seems more frequent than ever before, and it's been a delight to see it. But we could use more. We still don't seem to have much in the way of core frameworks and core theory for social agents. I seek to identify some of the promising murky gaps and illuminate them, then bridge the bridgeable ones.</p>
				
				<h2 id="research">Research Topics</h2>
				<h3>Social Power</h3>
				<p>Social power is the "dark energy" permeating the social sciences. Everyone knows something is there&mdash;we see its effects!&mdash;but no one is really sure what it is or how to define it as a technical notion that holds across domains. This could go one of two ways: either this folk notion of power is such an amalgam of stuff it's useless, or maybe there really is a technical notion that can usefully model all or most of the folk notion. I used to think it had to be the former: a scientifically-useless bag of stuff. I now think it's&mdash;quite surprisingly&mdash;the latter. Not every folk notion of social power can make it into the technical definition, but overall it should be fairly painless. I plan to focus on developing a framework for social power and a few domain-specific models that show the theoretical "API" of that framework during my PhD.</p>
				
				<h3>Rent-seeking</h3>
				<p>Can we define rent-seeking in a way that scales from the small to the megasocietal? What influences this tendency? Is it enough for an agent to be insensitive to advantage, versus sensitive to disadvantage, to enable agents to capitalize on shocks by rent-seeking? What about the power that rent-seeking can bring? Is there any relation between rent-seeking and avoiding transparency? In a similar vein as the "cooperative phenotype" paper by Peysakhovich et al. (2014), can we look at rent-seeking as a phenotype?</p>
				
				<h3>Variations in Agent-Based Models</h3>
				<p>What happens if we model agent beliefs as probability distributions rather than point estimates? Can this help explain variability in empirical evidence, resulting in better model fit?</p>
				<p>Information latency across a group can mean that it's still better for someone significantly unskilled at a task to take action rather than to wait for instruction or assistance from other agents. In what range of conditions is this tradeoff worth it?</p>
				<p>People face transparency and privacy tradeoffs within their culture, including likelihood of and costs for detecting others and/or escaping detection themselves, and also risks of false positives. How much privacy or discretion is too much or too little? What are the context-dependent patterns? Do major shifts occur with group size?</p>
				<p>Fluid and crystalized intelligence change over time, and affect performance. How does this impact a group of varied agents? Does this have additional implications for collective intelligence, network stability, and resilience?</p>
				
				<h3>Machine Theorizing (and Framework and Model Building)</h3>
				<p>Machine learning is considered black box, which it is, but that doesn't prevent us from using it as part of a system to build theories. At the very least, I think we can develop the ability to build human-comprehensible agent-based models from certain types or data. First, before theorizing, comes observation. Then, after many observations, noticing a pattern. With observational data, transisions between states or behaviors can be used to build an agent. An increasingly sensored world and resulting big data provides particular types of observations aplenty.</p>
								
				<h2 id="about">About</h2>
				<p>Stan Rhodes is a tech writer in the same department as former tech writer Chuck Palahniuk. Stan feels no need to write his own <i>Fight Club</i>, but feels an INTENSE, UNQUENCHABLE THIRST for building core theory among the social sciences.</p>
				
				<p>Out of college Stan did tech writing and GUI testing for a small startup. The company failed, but the experience was instructive. Stan had then, somewhat accidentally, established a career.</p>
				
				<p>Stan began working for other software companies in the Portland, OR area. After entering the corporate workforce, he began reading social science research regularly. These daily readings helped sustain his science mindparts as he adjusted to the realities corporate life.</p>
				
				<p>Stan's interest in core theory for the social sciences was most strongly nourished and guided by the profilic Herbert Gintis. His papers and books? Yes, but more crucially, his Amazon book reviews. Seriously! Stan saw how broad social science really was, and began to see the disciplines as different domains of one social science that had many overlapping areas. The transformation was gradual: book reviews to reviewed books, books to published papers, papers to pre-prints and seminars.</p>

				<p>It took time for Stan to believe he could enter academia. Did he have the stuff? What was the stuff, anyway? Ultimately he realized that the world, and he himself, would be better off if he gave his best working hours a week to the scientific enterprise rather than the corporate enterprise.</p>
				
				<p>Stan is also a board member and Treasurer of Alberta Grocery Coop and an officer in his corporate Toastmasters club, where he pretends not to be an introvert (with some success).</p>
