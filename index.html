        		<p>I investigate what big factors in environments, and in the social and cognitive properties of people, lead to patterns of organizational structure such as hierarchies. I'm currently a PhD candidate at Utah State University, co-advised by Dr. Stefani Crabtree and Dr. Jacob Freeman. I use agent-based models, network analysis, and statistical learning techniques.</p>
				
				<p>As someone training to be a computational social scientist, I am interested in hierarchy and social power from a perspective of collective computation, and I am fascinated by processes managing collective action problems in complex systems.</p>
				
				<p>As an interdisciplinary scientist and concerned earthling, I am also interested in more practical topics touching upon organizational structures and complex systems: What organizations and institutions do we need for the climate change challenge we face? What organizational transitions are needed for social movements to create new organizations with functional permanence, and is that even a good idea? At first these may seem like questions at the global scale. But they are also questions for small businesses, community organizations, local chapters of social movements, university extension programs, and neighborhood cooperatives.</p>
				
				<p>I recently wrote an <a href="https://stanleyrhodes.github.io/rhodes_colorblind-friendly_abma.pdf">appendix on making colorblind-friendly agent-based models</a> for <i><a href="https://www.sfipress.org/books/agent-based-modeling-archaeology">Agent-Based Modeling for Archaeology: Simulating the Complexity of Societies</a></i>. Check out the whole book too, it rocks! I'm always open to feedback, feel free to drop me a line.
