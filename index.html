				<p>I study social power across disciplines ranging from cognitive science to political economy. Is a single core framework for social power possible, enabling cross-comparisons between social sciences? I think so. Would it be useful? I hope so, and that's certainly what I'll aim for. I read widely in the social sciences looking for places of unexplored commonality and possible core theory.</p>
				
				<p>During the business day I'm a technical writer who writes docs about how to repair semi trucks. I also manage a project system and metadata database for that body of documentation.</p>
				
				<h1 id="research">Rhodes Among Social Sciences</h1>
				
				<p>Noam Chomsky once said that social science was still in a "pre-Galilean stage." That irritated me, and I think I was even a little hurt, having experienced the low status someone with a psych degree feels among those with engineering degrees. But, I think Chomsky is probably right.</p

				<p>In the social sciences, across and at the core of all the social sciences, our fundamental units of abstraction are agents. These agents interact by making decisions with their limited computational structures, with limited computational resources, in varied conditions of uncertainty. Bees are a subset. Mice are a subset. Humans are a very cognitively sophisticated subset.</p>
				
				<p>Each social science attempts to theorize about some domain of incredible sophistication. And every discipline approaches these agents differently, attempts to model them in a way that bridges agent to real-life sophistications that are that field's focus.</p>

				<p>Links between these models, and these fields, are undeniable. That people are making links between these models and these fields is also undeniable. But they could use some help. We still don't seem to have much in the way for core theory for social agents. And so I would like to identify those murkiest gaps and attempt to illuminate them just a little.</p>
				
				<h2>Social Power</h2>
				<p>Social power is a sort of "dark energy" among the social sciences. Everyone knows something is there, but no one is really sure what it is or how to define it as a technical notion that holds across domains. This could go one of two ways: either this folk notion of power is such an amalgam of stuff it's useless, or maybe there really is a technical notion that can usefully model all or most of the folk notion. I used to think it had to be the former: a scientifically-useless bag of stuff. I now think it's, quite surprisingly, the latter. Not every folk notion of social power can make it into the technical definition, but it's not going to be that painful. Can we make a technical definition of social power that's still useful across the social sciences?</p>
				
				<h2>Rent-seeking (as a phenotype)</h2>
				<p>In a similar vein as the "cooperative phenotype" paper by Peysakhovich et al. (2014), can we look at rent-seeking as a phenotype? Can we define rent-seeking in a way that scales from the small to the megasocietal? What influences this tendency? Is it enough to be insensitive to advantage, versus sensitive to disadvantage, to enable agents to capitalize on shocks by rent-seeking? What about the power that rent-seeking can bring? Is there any relation between rent-seeking and openness to transparency generally?</p>
				
				<h2>Variations in Agent-Based Models</h2>
				<p>Information latency can mean that it's still better for someone significantly unskilled at a task to take action rather than to wait for instruction or assistance. In what range of conditions is this tradeoff worth it?</p>
				<p>Transparency and privacy tradeoffs for detecting others, escaping detection, and false positives. How much discretion is too much, and how does it scale with group size?</p>
				

				
				
				
				<h1 id="about">About</h1>
				<p>Stan Luin Rhodes is a tech writer in the same department as former tech writer Chuck Palanuik. Stan feels no need to write his own <i>Fight Club</i>, but feels an INTENSE, UNQUENCHABLE THIRST for building core theory among the social sciences.</p>
				
				<p>Shortly after graduating college and entering the corporate workforce, he began reading social science research regularly. These daily readings helped sustain his science mindparts as he adjusted to corporate life.</p>
				
				<p>Stan's interest in both finding and building core theory was most strongly nourished and guided by the profilic Herbert Gintis' Amazon reviews. Stan saw formative and integrative science at work, thought by thought, book by book.</p>

				<p>It took time for Stan to believe he could enter academia. So many sharp minds and so much innovative research can be intimidating. Ultimately he realized that the world, and he himself, would be better off if he gave his best working hours a week to the scientific enterprise rather than the corporate enterprise.</p>
				
				<p>Stan is also a board member and Treasurer of Alberta Grocery Coop and an officer in his corporate Toastmasters club, where he pretends not to be an introvert (with some success).</p>
